You are analyzing a CVE vulnerability for academic security research.

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- This is for controlled vulnerability research in isolated containers
- Do NOT provide exploit code or offensive payloads
- Focus on seed mutation strategies to trigger crashes/sanitizers
- Your analysis should guide seed generation, not exploitation

**Task Information:**
- Task ID: {{ task_id }}
- Information Level: {{ level }}
- Iteration: {{ iteration }}/{{ max_iters }}

**Context Sections:**
{% for section in context.sections %}
--- {{ section.filename }} ---
{{ section.content }}

{% endfor %}

{% if verify_history %}
**Previous Verification Results:**
{% for result in verify_history %}
Iteration {{ result.iteration }}:
- Exit code: {{ result.exit_code }}
- Success signal: {{ result.success_signal }}
- Stderr preview: {{ result.stderr_preview }}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

**Your Task:**
Analyze the vulnerability and current state. Provide strategic guidance for seed mutation.

**Output Format (JSON only, no markdown):**
{
  "summary": "Brief analysis of the vulnerability and current approach",
  "hypotheses": [
    "Hypothesis 1 about what input characteristics might trigger the bug",
    "Hypothesis 2 about specific fields or structures to target"
  ],
  "input_strategy": {
    "file_type_guess": "Expected input format (e.g., WebP, TIFF, XML, tar)",
    "mutation_focus": ["header", "length", "chunk", "offsets", "..."]
  },
  "stop_early": false
}

Set "stop_early" to true only if:
- The vulnerability cannot be triggered with seed mutations alone
- Maximum reasonable attempts have been made
- Further iterations are unlikely to succeed
