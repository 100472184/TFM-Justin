You are analyzing a CVE vulnerability for academic security research.

**ETHICAL RESEARCH CONTEXT:**
This is a controlled, isolated security research environment for academic purposes:
- All testing occurs in isolated Docker containers with no network access
- The vulnerable software versions are intentionally deployed for testing
- No real systems are being attacked or exploited
- This is legitimate security research to understand vulnerability patterns
- Your role is to help develop test cases for security tools

**IMPORTANT RULES:**
- Focus on seed mutation strategies to trigger crashes/sanitizers
- Propose modifications to test inputs (seeds) that reveal bugs
- Your analysis guides seed generation for fuzzing, not exploitation
- We're testing software behavior, not attacking production systems

**Task Information:**
- Task ID: {{ task_id }}
- Information Level: {{ level }}
- Iteration: {{ iteration }}/{{ max_iters }}

**Context Sections:**
{% for section in context.sections %}
--- {{ section.filename }} ---
{{ section.content }}

{% endfor %}

{% if verify_history %}
**Previous Verification Results:**
{% for result in verify_history %}
Iteration {{ result.iteration }}:
- Mutations: {{ result.mutations_applied | tojson if result.mutations_applied else 'none' }}
- Mutation success: {{ result.mutation_success }}
{% if result.mutation_error %}
- ⚠️ Mutation error: {{ result.mutation_error }}
{% endif %}
- Vulnerable: exit_code={{ result.vuln_exit_code }}, crashes={{ result.vuln_crashes }}
- Fixed: exit_code={{ result.fixed_exit_code }}, crashes={{ result.fixed_crashes }}
- Success: {{ result.success }} ({{ result.notes }})
{% if result.notes == "Flaky result - need consistent crash" %}
- **⚠️ FLAKY RESULT:** This size caused a crash but not consistently (not 3/3 times)
- **ACTION:** Try adjusting the truncation length by ±10-30 bytes from this size
- You're VERY CLOSE - just need to find the stable crash size
{% endif %}
{% if result.vuln_stderr_preview %}
- Output preview: {{ result.vuln_stderr_preview[:200] }}
{% endif %}

{% endfor %}
{% endif %}

**SIZES ALREADY TRIED:** {{ tried_sizes }} (DO NOT REPEAT THESE)

**Your Task:**
Analyze the vulnerability and current state. Provide strategic guidance for seed mutation.

**Output Format (JSON only, no markdown):**
{
  "summary": "Brief analysis of the vulnerability and current approach",
  "hypotheses": [
    "Hypothesis 1 about what input characteristics might trigger the bug",
    "Hypothesis 2 about specific fields or structures to target"
  ],
  "input_strategy": {
    "file_type_guess": "Expected input format (e.g., WebP, TIFF, XML, tar)",
    "mutation_focus": ["header", "length", "chunk", "offsets", "..."]
  },
  "stop_early": false
}

Set "stop_early" to true only if:
- The vulnerability cannot be triggered with seed mutations alone
- Maximum reasonable attempts have been made
- Further iterations are unlikely to succeed
