{
  "summary": "The vulnerability in libarchive (CVE-2024-57970) is due to an incorrect handling of truncated GNU long linkname headers during TAR parsing. The current approach has not yet triggered the intended ASan crash, possibly because the mutation sizes are either too large or too small to cause a heap buffer over-read in the vulnerable version (3.7.7).",
  "hypotheses": [
    "The vulnerability might be triggered by a precise size of truncation that falls within the range where the `strlen` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer, but is not large enough to trigger an ASan error in the fixed version.",
    "Specific offsets within the header or data blocks might be more critical than the overall length. The truncation should ideally occur within the name data region."
