  "summary": "The CVE-2024-57970 in libarchive involves a heap buffer over-read due to the incorrect handling of truncated GNU long linkname data. The vulnerability is present in versions \u22643.7.7 and fixed in 3.7.8. The base seed needs mutation, specifically through simple truncation within the name data section, to trigger the bug.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "The bug occurs when the archive ends before the full long-linkname data is read, leading to an incomplete buffer that `strlen()` over-reads.",
    "Truncating just beyond the declared size of the GNU long linkname data will likely trigger the vulnerability."
