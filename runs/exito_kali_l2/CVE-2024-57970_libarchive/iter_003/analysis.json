  "summary": "The current approach involves truncating the archive to create an incomplete GNU long linkname structure, which is necessary to trigger a heap buffer over-read in the vulnerable version (3.7.7). The fixed version handles such cases gracefully. Previous attempts with specific sizes have not yet resulted in crashes.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "The vulnerability might be triggered by truncating just before or within the GNU long linkname data to create an incomplete structure that causes `strlen` to read past allocated memory.",
    "Header and length fields are critical, as they control how much of the name data is expected versus actually present."
