  "rationale": "Given that previous truncation attempts of 2048 and 3071 bytes were not successful, reducing the size further to 512 bytes might reveal more about the boundary conditions where the vulnerability could be triggered. This size is also a significant reduction from the base seed, which could potentially expose the incomplete long-linkname handling issue."
