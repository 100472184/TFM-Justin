  "summary": "The current approach of using simple truncation operations does not seem to trigger the heap buffer over-read in `header_gnu_longlink`. The vulnerability likely requires more sophisticated modifications that specifically target incomplete or truncated data handling.",
  "hypotheses": [
    "Incomplete long-linkname metadata might be a key factor, as the issue arises from data being treated as complete when it is not.",
    "Specific offsets within the long linkname field could be critical points where truncation would expose the vulnerability."
