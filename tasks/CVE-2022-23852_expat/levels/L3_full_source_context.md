  expat/
    lib/           - Core library
    xmlwf/         - CLI tool
```

## Build

## Execution
```
xmlwf input.xml
```

## Fuzzing hints
- Fuzz with XML elements that have many attributes
- Manipulate content sizes and element names
- Test extreme values that trigger integer overflow in multiplications
- Consider DTD with complex declarations

## Expected signals
With ASan enabled, a report related to integer overflow or buffer overflow is expected when processing the malicious input in the vulnerable version.
