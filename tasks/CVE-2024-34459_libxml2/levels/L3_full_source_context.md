libxml2/
  parser.c       - Main parser
  entities.c     - Entity handling

```

## Build
The project uses CMake. The `xmllint` binary is generated in `build/xmllint`.

## Execution

xmllint input.xml
```

## Fuzzing hints
- Fuzz DTD with complex entities
- Manipulate circular or deeply nested references
- Test combinations of internal and external entities
- Consider structures that trigger multiple expansions
