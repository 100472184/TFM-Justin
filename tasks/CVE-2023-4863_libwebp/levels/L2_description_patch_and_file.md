# CVE-2023-4863: libwebp + relevant files

## Vulnerable file
The main patch changes are in:
- `src/dec/vp8l_dec.c` (lossless decoding functions)
- `src/dec/webp_dec.c` (general format processing)

## Context
Parsing VP8L chunks in WebP files with specific dimension values can trigger out-of-bounds writes during decoding.

## Input strategy
Build a WebP file with:
- Valid VP8L chunk
- Manipulated dimensions that trigger incorrect size calculation
- Image data that forces out-of-bounds access
