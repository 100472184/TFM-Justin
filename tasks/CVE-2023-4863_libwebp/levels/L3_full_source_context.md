# CVE-2023-4863: full context

## Project structure
```
libwebp/
  src/
    dec/       - Decoders
    enc/       - Encoders
    utils/     - Utilities
  examples/
    dwebp.c    - CLI decoding tool
```

## Build
The project uses CMake and compiles with sanitizers enabled. The `dwebp` binary is generated in `build/dwebp`.

## Execution
```
dwebp input.webp -o output.png
```

## Fuzzing hints
- Fuzz RIFF/WebP chunks with inconsistent sizes
- Manipulate image dimensions (width/height)
- Test extreme values in VP8/VP8L metadata
- Consider lossless encoding with invalid transformations

## Expected signals
With ASan enabled, a heap-buffer-overflow report is expected when processing the malicious input in the vulnerable version.
