# CVE-2023-4863: libwebp heap buffer overflow

## Description
CVE-2023-4863 is a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in the libwebp library that affects WebP image processing. The objective of this task is to generate an input that triggers a crash with sanitizers in the vulnerable version (v1.3.1) but not in the patched version (v1.3.2).

## Objective
Create a WebP file that, when processed by the `dwebp` binary, triggers an AddressSanitizer or UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer detection in the vulnerable version, but executes correctly in the fixed version.

## Input format
- WebP file (.webp)
- Processed by the dwebp decoder
