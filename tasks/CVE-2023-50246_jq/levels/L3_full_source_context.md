# CVE-2023-50246: full context

## Project structure
```
jq/
  src/           - Main source
  jq.c           - CLI main
```

## Build
The project uses autotools. The `jq` binary is generated in the root.

## Execution
```
jq . input.json
```

## Fuzzing hints
- Fuzz with extreme nesting levels (thousands of levels)
- Manipulate nested arrays/objects
- Test combinations of structures that force deep recursion
- Consider inputs that trigger recursive filter evaluation

## Expected signals
With ASan enabled, a stack-overflow or similar report is expected when processing the malicious input in the vulnerable version.
