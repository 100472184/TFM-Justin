# CVE-2023-50246: jq stack exhaustion

## Description
CVE-2023-50246 is a stack exhaustion vulnerability in jq that affects recursive JSON structure processing. The objective of this task is to generate an input that triggers a crash with sanitizers in the vulnerable version (jq-1.7) but not in the patched version (jq-1.7.1).

## Objective
Create a JSON file that, when processed by the `jq` binary, triggers an AddressSanitizer or UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer detection in the vulnerable version, but executes correctly in the fixed version.

## Input format
- JSON file (.json)
- Processed by jq with basic filter "."
