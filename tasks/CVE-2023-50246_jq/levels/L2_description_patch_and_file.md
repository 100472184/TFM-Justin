# CVE-2023-50246: jq + relevant files

## Vulnerable file
The main patch changes are in:
- `src/jv.c` (JSON value handling)
- `src/execute.c` (filter execution)

## Context
Parsing JSON with deeply nested structures can trigger stack overflow during evaluation.

## Input strategy
Build a JSON file with:
- Deeply nested arrays/objects
- Recursive structures that force multiple call levels
- Combinations that trigger stack exhaustion
