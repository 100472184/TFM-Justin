# CVE-2022-23990: full context

## Project structure
```
libexpat/
  expat/
    lib/           - Core library
    xmlwf/         - CLI tool
```

## Build
The project uses CMake. The `xmlwf` binary is generated in `expat/build/xmlwf`.

## Execution
```
xmlwf input.xml
```

## Fuzzing hints
- Fuzz with XML elements that have many namespace declarations
- Manipulate namespace prefixes and URIs
- Test extreme values in number of elements/namespaces
- Consider nested structures that trigger overflow in tracking

## Expected signals
With ASan enabled, a report related to integer overflow or buffer overflow is expected when processing the malicious input in the vulnerable version.
