# CVE-2023-50268: jq + relevant files

## Vulnerable file
The main patch changes are in:
- `src/jv.c` (JSON value handling)
- `src/jv_parse.c` (JSON parsing)

## Context
Parsing JSON strings with specific sequences can trigger out-of-bounds writes in internal buffers.

## Input strategy
Build a JSON file with:
- Strings with complex escape sequences
- Unicode characters or invalid sequences
- Combinations that trigger buffer overflow during parsing/handling
