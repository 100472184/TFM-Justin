# CVE-2023-6228: libtiff buffer overflow

## Description
CVE-2023-6228 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in libtiff that affects TIFF image processing. The objective of this task is to generate an input that triggers a crash with sanitizers in the vulnerable version (v4.6.0) but not in the patched version (v4.7.0).

## Objective
Create a TIFF file that, when processed by the `tiffcp` binary, triggers an AddressSanitizer or UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer detection in the vulnerable version, but executes correctly in the fixed version.

## Input format
- TIFF file (.tif/.tiff)
- Processed by the tiffcp tool (TIFF copy/conversion)
